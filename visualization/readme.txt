In this folder, scripts used for statistical tests and visualization can be found.

First of all, the script new_abundances_after_filtering.py was used to calculate the abundances after discarding the taxonomic classification with less than 5k. Those abundances were after that used in all the following scripts:

- beta_diversity.R: used to create fig 31 anf fig 32
- deseq2.R: fig 27
- heatmap_genus.R: fig 30
- spear.py: table 4 
- spear_rank.py: fig 26
- stack.R: fig 29
- stack_methanobrevibacter: fig 28
